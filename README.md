My name is Kevin Delassus. I am a 3rd Year Software Development Student in G.M.I.T. This is my submission for Data Representation and Querying, Problem Sheet 3.

## Running Problem Sheet 3
 To run the problem sheet you first need to make sure that you have GO on your PC.If you dont go to the link below and download and install GO.
 
    https://golang.org/
    

To complete the next step GIT is also required on you PC. If you don't have GIT installed go to the link below and download and install GIT

    https://git-scm.com/

Once both has been installed you are ready to run the go program
Open your CMD again and navigate to where you would like to clone the problem sheet repository. To clone enter:
```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/kevind992/Go_Problem_Sheet_3.git
```     
Once the repository has been cloned, navigate into the problem sheet folder.
To build the GO file enter:
```sh
   $ go build RegularExpressions.go
```    
To run the program, enter:    
```sh
    $ RegularExpressions.exe
```

The Regular Expression Program should now be running on the console.

The user will not be prompted to enter anything. All the inputs have been added to a String array.

### Pre-assigned user inputs.

-People say I look like both my mother and father.
-Father was a teacher.
-I was my father's favourite.
-I'm looking forward to the weekend.
-My grandfather was French!
-I am Happy.
-I'm not happy with you responses.
-I am not sure that you understand the effect that your questions are having on me.
-I am supposed to just take what you're saying at face value?
-What time is it?
-What date is it?
-I want to go home.

### What are Regular Expressions?
Adapted from: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions
A regular expression pattern is composed of simple characters, such as /abc/, or a combination of simple and special characters, such as /ab*c/ or /Chapter (\d+)\.\d*/. The last example includes parentheses which are used as a memory device. The match made with this part of the pattern is remembered for later use, as described in Using parenthesized substring matches.
